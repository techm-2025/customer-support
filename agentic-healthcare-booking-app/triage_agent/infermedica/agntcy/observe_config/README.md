## Introduction

In modern microservices architectures, robust observability is paramount. It provides the necessary insights into application behavior, performance, and potential issues, enabling rapid diagnosis and resolution. The initialize_observability function serves as the standardized entry point for setting up unified logging, metrics, and tracing for services leveraging the ioa_observe.sdk. By integrating with OpenTelemetry, it promotes vendor-agnostic telemetry collection, ensuring operational excellence.

## Key Concepts & SDK Overview

The `ioa_observe.sdk` is a powerful toolkit designed to simplify observability integration. It provides a set of in-built decorator components that allow developers to instrument their code with minimal effort, ensuring that telemetry data is automatically generated for key operational units.

### Observe SDK Decorators

The SDK offers specialized decorators for different types of code components:

*   **`@task`**: Used for individual, discrete functions or methods that perform specific, atomic operations.
    *   **Usage**: `@task(name='task_name')`
*   **`@tool`**: Applied to functions that act as tools or integrate with external services (e.g., API calls, database interactions).
    *   **Usage**: `@tool(name='tool_name')`
*   **`@agent`**: Designed for agent classes or methods that represent autonomous AI agents, capturing their execution flow and decisions.
    *   **Usage**: `@agent(name='agent_name', description='agent_description')`
*   **`@workflow`**: For orchestrating multiple tasks, agents, or complex business processes, providing an end-to-end view of a multi-step operation.
    *   **Usage**: `@workflow(name='workflow_name')`

These decorators automatically create spans and contextual information, enriching your traces and making it easier to understand the flow and performance of your application.

## Features

*   **Unified Observability**: Streamlines the initialization of logging, metrics, and tracing functionalities from a single function call.
*   **OpenTelemetry Compatibility**: Exports telemetry data via an OTLP HTTP endpoint, allowing integration with various OpenTelemetry-compatible collectors and observability platforms.
*   **Dynamic Configuration**: Utilizes environment variables for flexible configuration of the API endpoint, service version, and deployment environment.
*   **Service-Specific Attributes**: Automatically enriches telemetry data with essential resource attributes like `service.name`, `service.version`, `environment`, and `system.type` (fixed as "voice_agent").
*   **Robust Initialization**: Includes a verification step to confirm successful initialization of the tracing component and comprehensive error handling.
*   **Healthcare MAS Context**: Specifically tailored for "healthcare MAS" (Microservices Application System) environments, implying adherence to relevant standards or practices.
*   **Decorator-Based Instrumentation**: Simplifies code instrumentation through intuitive decorators (`@task`, `@tool`, `@agent`, `@workflow`), reducing boilerplate and promoting consistent telemetry capture.

## Design Philosophy

The `ioa_observe` SDK and its initialization function are built on the principle of "observability by default." By abstracting the complexities of OpenTelemetry setup and providing convenient decorators, it aims to:
*   **Minimize Developer Overhead**: Allow developers to focus on business logic rather than intricate observability configurations.
*   **Ensure Consistency**: Standardize how telemetry is collected across different services and components.
*   **Promote Best Practices**: Encourage the capture of rich, contextual telemetry data for effective troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
*   **Enable Scalability**: Support distributed tracing and metrics collection suitable for microservices architectures.

## Prerequisites

Before using this function, ensure you have the following:

*   **Python 3.x**: The code is written in Python and requires a compatible interpreter.
*   **`ioa_observe.sdk`**: This is an internal or custom SDK. You will need to obtain and install this package from your organization's internal package repository or source.
*   **Observability Backend**: An OpenTelemetry-compatible observability backend (e.g., OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, Prometheus, or a commercial observability platform) must be running and accessible at the configured `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT`.
*   **Docker and Docker Compose**: For local development and testing, `docker-compose` is essential for setting up the OpenTelemetry Collector, ClickHouse, and Grafana.

## Installation

1.  **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2.  **`ioa_observe.sdk`**: Install the `ioa_observe.sdk` package. The exact command will depend on how your organization distributes it.
    *   **From PyPI (if available)**: `pip install ioa_observe_sdk`
    *   **From Git Repository**: `pip install git+https://github.com/agntcy/observe` (or use `uv add` if using `uv` package manager).

## Configuration

The `initialize_observability` function and the local development environment rely on several environment variables for their configuration. These variables should typically be managed via a `.env` file for local development and through secure secrets management systems in production environments.

*   **`OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT`**: (Optional) The HTTP endpoint for the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporter. This is where your telemetry data will be sent.
    *   **Default**: `http://localhost:4318`
    *   **Example**: `export OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT="http://my-otel-collector:4318"`
*   **`SERVICE_NAME`**: (Optional) The name of your service. This is a crucial identifier for your service in the observability backend.
    *   **Default**: `observe_service`
    *   **Example**: `export SERVICE_NAME="observe_service"`
*   **`SERVICE_VERSION`**: (Optional) The version of your service. This is included as a resource attribute in all telemetry.
    *   **Default**: `1.0.0`
    *   **Example**: `export SERVICE_VERSION="2.1.0"`
*   **`ENVIRONMENT`**: (Optional) The deployment environment (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`). This is included as a resource attribute.
    *   **Default**: `development`
    *   **Example**: `export ENVIRONMENT="production"`

**Note on Metrics Endpoint**: The metrics endpoint is automatically derived from `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT` by replacing port `4318` with `4317` if `4318` is present. This is a common convention in OpenTelemetry setups where traces and logs use `4318` and metrics use `4317`.

### Local Configuration Files

For local development, you will typically set up the following files:

*   **`.env` file**: Stores local secrets and configuration variables.
    *   **Content**: Must contain `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT` and `SERVICE_NAME`. Other variables like `SERVICE_VERSION` and `ENVIRONMENT` are optional but recommended.
    *   **Example**:
        ```
        OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
        SERVICE_NAME=my-healthcare-agent
        SERVICE_VERSION=1.0.0
        ENVIRONMENT=development
        ```
*   **`docker-compose.yml`**: Defines the services required for your local observability stack (OpenTelemetry Collector, ClickHouse, Grafana).
    *   **Purpose**: To run the observability infrastructure locally.
    *   **Commands**:
        *   `docker-compose up -d`: Starts the services in detached mode.
        *   `docker-compose down`: Stops and removes the services.
        *   `docker-compose logs`: View logs from the services.
    *   **Reference**: [https://github.com/techm-2025/customer-support/tree/main/agentic-healthcare-booking-app/triage-agent/infermedica/agntcy/observe-config/deploy/docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/techm-2025/customer-support/tree/main/agentic-healthcare-booking-app/triage-agent/infermedica/agntcy/observe-config/deploy/docker-compose.yml)
*   **`otel-collector.yaml`**: Configuration for the OpenTelemetry Collector, specifying how it collects, processes, and exports traces, metrics, and logs (e.g., to ClickHouse).
    *   **Purpose**: To collect and transport telemetry data to the chosen backend.
    *   **Reference**: [https://github.com/techm-2025/customer-support/tree/main/agentic-healthcare-booking-app/triage-agent/infermedica/agntcy/observe-config/deploy/otel/otel-collector.yaml](https://github.com/techm-2025/customer-support/tree/main/agentic-healthcare-booking-app/triage-agent/infermedica/agntcy/observe-config/deploy/otel/otel-collector.yaml)

## Getting Started (Local Development)

This section outlines the steps to set up and integrate observability into your application for local development and testing.

### Initial Setup

1.  **Required Files**: Ensure you have `docker-compose.yml`, `otel-collector.yaml`, and an `observe` initialization file (containing the `initialize_observability` function) in your project.
2.  **`.env` File**: Create a `.env` file in your project root to store local configuration variables, including `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT` and `SERVICE_NAME`.
3.  **Initialize Observe**: It is crucial to initialize the `observe` SDK *before* invoking any agents or decorated functions. This ensures that the observability context is established from the very beginning of your application's execution.

### Decorator Integration

1.  **Import Decorators**: Import the necessary decorators from the `ioa_observe.sdk.decorators` module:
    ```python
    from ioa_observe.sdk.decorators import agent, tool, workflow, task
    ```
2.  **Apply Decorators**: Apply the appropriate decorators to your functions, methods, or classes based on their role:
    ```python
    # Example: A discrete function
    @task(name='process_data')
    def process_data(data):
        # ... logic ...
        return processed_data

    # Example: An external service integration
    @tool(name='call_api')
    def fetch__record(doc_id):
        # ... API call logic ...
        return record_data

    # Example: An AI agent method
    @agent(name='chatbot', description='AI agent for inquiries')
    class Chatbot:
        def __init__(self):
            pass
        # ... agent methods ...

    # Example: A complex business process
    @workflow(name='onboarding_workflow')
    def onboarding_flow(info):
        # ... orchestrate tasks and tools ...
        return onboarding_status
    ```

### Local Execution Steps

1.  **Install SDK**:
    ```bash
    pip install ioa_observe_sdk # or uv add git+https://github.com/agntcy/observe
    ```
2.  **Setup Files**: Ensure `docker-compose.yml`, `otel-collector.yaml`, `.env`, and your observability initialization code are correctly set up.
3.  **Integrate Decorators**: Import and apply the `ioa_observe` decorators to your source code as described above.
4.  **Initialize Observe**: Make sure to call `initialize_observability` early in your application's lifecycle.
    ```python
    import os
    # ... other imports ...

    # The initialize_observability function as provided in the original prompt
    def initialize_observability(service_name):
        """Initialize observability with proper configuration for healthcare MAS"""
        try:
            from ioa_observe.sdk.logging.logging import LoggerWrapper
            from ioa_observe.sdk.metrics.metrics import MetricsWrapper
            from ioa_observe.sdk.tracing.tracing import TracerWrapper
            from ioa_observe.sdk import Observe

            service_name_actual = os.getenv("SERVICE_NAME", service_name) # Use provided service_name or .env
            api_endpoint = os.getenv("OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT", "http://localhost:4318")

            print(f"OBSERVE_INIT: Initializing observability for service: {service_name_actual}")

            Observe.init(service_name_actual, api_endpoint=api_endpoint)

            TracerWrapper.set_static_params(
                resource_attributes={
                    "service.name": service_name_actual,
                    "service.version": os.getenv("SERVICE_VERSION", "1.0.0"),
                    "environment": os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development"),
                    "system.type": "voice_agent"
                },
                enable_content_tracing=True,
                endpoint=api_endpoint,
                headers={}
            )

            LoggerWrapper.set_static_params(
                resource_attributes={
                    "service.name": service_name_actual,
                    "service.version": os.getenv("SERVICE_VERSION", "1.0.0"),
                    "environment": os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
                },
                endpoint=api_endpoint,
                headers={}
            )

            metrics_endpoint = api_endpoint.replace('4318','4317') if "4318" in api_endpoint else api_endpoint
            MetricsWrapper.set_static_params(
                resource_attributes={
                    "service.name": service_name_actual,
                    "service.version": os.getenv("SERVICE_VERSION", "1.0.0")
                },
                endpoint=metrics_endpoint,
                headers={}
            )

            MetricsWrapper()
            TracerWrapper()
            LoggerWrapper()

            # Verify initialization
            if not TracerWrapper.verify_initialized():
                raise Exception("TracerWrapper failed to initialize")
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"OBSERVE_INIT: Error initializing observability: {e}")
            return False

    # In your main application file:
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        service_name_for_init = "my-application" # This will be overridden by SERVICE_NAME env var if set
        if initialize_observability(service_name_for_init):
            print("Observability initialized. Your application can now send telemetry.")
            # Your main application logic here
            # Example: call a decorated function
            # process_data(...)
        else:
            print("Failed to initialize observability.")
    ```
5.  **Start Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
6.  **Run Source Code**: Execute your Python application.
7.  **Check Logs**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs
    ```
8.  **Access ClickHouse DB**: To inspect raw telemetry data:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it clickhouse-server clickhouse-client
    ```
9.  **Visualize in Grafana**: Access Grafana at `http://localhost:3000` to view dashboards and explore metrics, traces, and logs.

## How It Works

1.  **`Observe.init(service_name, api_endpoint)`**: This is the primary entry point for the `ioa_observe` SDK, setting up the core observability client with the given service name and OTLP endpoint. It establishes the global context for telemetry.
2.  **`TracerWrapper.set_static_params(...)`**: Configures the tracing client, including essential resource attributes (`service.name`, `service.version`, `environment`, `system.type`), enabling content tracing, and specifying the OTLP endpoint for traces.
3.  **`LoggerWrapper.set_static_params(...)`**: Configures the logging client with similar resource attributes and the OTLP endpoint for logs.
4.  **`MetricsWrapper.set_static_params(...)`**: Configures the metrics client with resource attributes and a potentially different OTLP endpoint (port 4317 is common for metrics, while 4318 is common for traces/logs).
5.  **Wrapper Instantiation**: `MetricsWrapper()`, `TracerWrapper()`, and `LoggerWrapper()` are called to finalize the setup and make the respective observability clients available for use throughout the application. These instances are typically singleton-like, providing access to the configured OpenTelemetry SDK components.
6.  **Decorator Action**: When a decorated function (`@task`, `@tool`, `@agent`, `@workflow`) is called, the decorator automatically intercepts the call, creates an OpenTelemetry span, sets relevant attributes, and manages the span's lifecycle (start, end, error handling). This span is then sent via the configured `TracerWrapper` to the OTLP endpoint.

## Cloud Environment Deployment

### Overview

Deploying observability components in a cloud environment, such as AWS EC2, requires careful orchestration to ensure secure, scalable, and reliable telemetry collection. This guide outlines the process for setting up the `ioa_observe` observability stack (OpenTelemetry Collector, ClickHouse, Grafana) and integrating your application.

### Deployment Guide

1.  **Access the EC2 Instance**:
    *   Establish a secure SSH connection to your designated EC2 cloud server.
    *   `ssh -i <your-ssh-key.pem> ec2-user@<your-ec2-public-ip>`
    *   *Note: Replace `<your-ssh-key.pem>` and `<your-ec2-public-ip>` with your actual SSH key and EC2 public IP.*

2.  **Organize the Environment**:
    *   Create a dedicated directory structure on the EC2 instance to house all deployment-related files.
    *   `mkdir -p ~<folderpath>/observe/deploy`
    *   `cd ~<folderpath>/observe/deploy`
    *   *Note: Replace `<folderpath>` with your desired path.*

3.  **Prepare Configuration Files**:
    *   Download the necessary deployment configuration files from the provided GitHub repository.

    *   **Option 1: Clone the Entire Repo**
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/repo_name.git
        cp -r <folder_path>/observe/deploy/* .
        ```

    *   **Option 2: Download Only the Deploy Directory**
        ```bash
        wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 \
        https://github.com/repo_name/observe/deploy
        ```

4.  **Configure `.env` File**:
    *   Edit the `.env` file within your deployment directory to match your environment's requirements.
    *   **Example `.env` content**:
        ```
        COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=my_project
        ENVIRONMENT=production
        DOMAIN=your-domain.com # Optional, if you have a domain
        SSL_EMAIL=admin@your-domain.com # Optional, for SSL certificates

        CLICKHOUSE_USER=admin
        CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=your_secure_clickhouse_password # IMPORTANT: Set a strong password
        CLICKHOUSE_DB=your_db_name

        GRAFANA_ADMIN_USER=admin
        GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_grafana_password # IMPORTANT: Set a strong password

        DATA_PATH=/opt/observe/data # Path for persistent data storage
        ```
    *   *Note: Ensure strong, unique passwords are set for `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` and `GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.*

5.  **Execute Deployment Automation**:
    *   Make the deployment script executable and run it.
    *   `chmod +x deploy.sh`
    *   `./deploy.sh`
    *   *Note: Replace `deploy.sh` with your actual deployment script name if it differs.*

6.  **Secure Credentials and Endpoints**:
    *   After running the script, carefully copy and securely store the generated credentials and service URLs displayed in your terminal. These typically include:
        *   ClickHouse URL & password
        *   Grafana URL & admin password
        *   OpenTelemetry Collector HTTP endpoint

7.  **Integrate OpenTelemetry Endpoint**:
    *   Update your application's configuration (e.g., a `.env` file or secrets manager) with the provided OpenTelemetry HTTP endpoint. This tells your application where to send its telemetry data.
    *   `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector-endpoint` (e.g., `http://<your-ec2-private-ip>:4318`)
    *   `ENDPOINTs = http://your-ec2-ip:port` (This might refer to other service endpoints exposed by your EC2 instance)

8.  **Access and Visualize with Grafana**:
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the Grafana URL provided during deployment.
    *   Log in using the generated administrator credentials.
    *   Configure data sources (e.g., ClickHouse) and import or create dashboards as needed to visualize your application's observe data.

### Important Considerations

*   **Security Group Configuration**: Ensure that the necessary ports (listed below) are open in your EC2 security group to allow inbound traffic to Grafana, ClickHouse, and the OpenTelemetry Collector.
*   **Credential Management**: All credentials and endpoints generated must be kept confidential and never committed to source control. Use secure secrets management solutions in production.
*   **Environment Variables**: If your deployment script or configuration files require specific environment variables beyond those in the `.env` example, update them as needed.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Ensure the `DATA_PATH` specified in your `.env` file is configured for persistent storage (e.g., an attached EBS volume) to prevent data loss upon instance termination or restart.

### Required Ports

To ensure proper communication within your observability stack and for external access:

*   **Grafana Dashboard**: `3000` (for web UI access)
*   **OTEL gRPC endpoint**: `4317` (for gRPC-based telemetry, often metrics)
*   **OTEL HTTP endpoint**: `4318` (for HTTP-based telemetry, often traces and logs)
*   **OTEL Metrics (optional)**: `8888` (if the collector exposes a Prometheus endpoint for its own metrics)
*   **OTEL Health Check (optional)**: `13133` (for collector health checks)

## Security Considerations

*   **Endpoint Security**: Ensure the OTLP endpoint is secured, especially in production. Use TLS/SSL for encrypted communication and restrict network access to only authorized services or networks.
*   **Credential Handling**: Never hardcode API keys, database passwords, or other sensitive credentials. Utilize environment variables, secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault), or Kubernetes Secrets.
*   **Data Minimization**: Be mindful of what data is sent as telemetry. Avoid including personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive patient health information (PHI) in logs, traces, or metrics unless absolutely necessary and properly anonymized/encrypted, adhering to healthcare compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA).
*   **Access Control**: Implement strict access control for your observability backend (Grafana, ClickHouse) to ensure only authorized personnel can view sensitive operational data.

## Performance Impact

The `ioa_observe` SDK is designed to be lightweight and efficient. However, any form of instrumentation introduces some overhead.
*   **Minimal Overhead**: The use of decorators and the underlying OpenTelemetry SDK is optimized for low latency and minimal CPU usage.
*   **Batching and Asynchronous Export**: Telemetry data is typically batched and exported asynchronously to minimize impact on application performance.
*   **Configuration Impact**: The volume of data collected (e.g., verbose logging, high-cardinality metrics) and the network latency to the OTLP endpoint can influence performance. Monitor your application's resource usage and adjust sampling rates or data collection levels if necessary.

## Error Handling

The `initialize_observability` function includes robust error handling:
*   It is wrapped in a `try-except` block, catching any exceptions that occur during the initialization process.
*   In case of an error, an informative message is printed to `stdout`, and the function returns `False`, allowing the calling application to react appropriately (e.g., log a critical error, run in a degraded mode without observability, or exit).
*   A `TracerWrapper.verify_initialized()` check ensures that the tracing component is successfully set up, raising an `Exception` if it fails, indicating a critical issue.

## Verification

A critical step in the initialization process is the verification of the tracing component. The `TracerWrapper.verify_initialized()` method is called to confirm that the tracing SDK has been properly configured and is ready to capture spans. This proactive check helps identify and prevent issues where telemetry might silently fail to be collected.

## Best Practices

*   **Early Initialization**: Always call `initialize_observability` at the very beginning of your application's lifecycle.
*   **Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent `service_name`, `task_name`, `tool_name`, `agent_name`, and `workflow_name` across your services for easier analysis.
*   **Contextual Attributes**: Add meaningful attributes to your spans and logs to provide richer context (e.g., `user_id`, `patient_id`, `request_id`).
*   **Monitor Observability Stack**: Ensure your OpenTelemetry Collector, ClickHouse, and Grafana instances are themselves monitored for health and performance.
*   **Sampling**: In high-volume environments, consider implementing trace sampling strategies to manage the amount of data collected and reduce costs, without losing critical insights.
*   **Documentation**: Document the meaning of your custom metrics and log fields for future reference.

## Troubleshooting

*   **"TracerWrapper failed to initialize"**: Check your `OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT` environment variable. Ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector is running and accessible at the specified address and port.
*   **No Telemetry Data**:
    *   Verify `initialize_observability` returned `True`.
    *   Check `docker-compose logs` for errors in the collector, ClickHouse, or Grafana.
    *   Ensure your application code is correctly importing and applying the `ioa_observe` decorators.
    *   Confirm network connectivity between your application and the OTLP endpoint.
    *   Check firewall rules and security groups in cloud environments.
*   **Incorrect Data**:
    *   Review your decorator `name` and `description` parameters for accuracy.
    *   Inspect raw data in ClickHouse to understand what's being sent.
    *   Check the `otel-collector.yaml` configuration for correct processing and export rules.
*   **Grafana Issues**:
    *   Ensure Grafana is running (`docker-compose ps`).
    *   Verify data source configuration in Grafana (e.g., ClickHouse connection details).
    *   Check Grafana logs for errors.
